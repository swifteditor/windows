# ðŸ”¨ Swift's Lua Editor Windows Edition
A feature-rich Windows application tailored for Lua scripting, built with Electron and powered by Swift's Text Editor for an optimized editing experience.

# Updates
- Removed custom buttons (we had an implementation of custom buttons but due to us adding it directly into the editor it was no longer needed)<br>
- Tab/Index System (You can now add and remove tabs to edit multiple files at once)<br>
- Refurbished some of the applications code (we have gone through and made the source more user friendly)
